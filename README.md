# cwcp - Current Working Directory to Clipboard
So I was so easy to run `pwd | pbcopy` to copy the current working directory to the clipboard in my macos environment computer. So I wrote a simple rust program to do that. I could also define alias in my shell config but if there is a way to do it in rust, why not?
